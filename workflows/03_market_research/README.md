# Workflow 03: Market Research That Replicates

**Doing market research with Claude that you can actually stand behind next quarter.**

> ⚠️ **In development.** This workflow is not yet complete. What follows is the design intent. Contributions from operators and analysts who do this kind of work regularly are welcome.

## What this workflow will cover

Market research done with LLMs has a specific failure pattern: it's fast, it sounds authoritative, and it has a short shelf life. Claude's training data has a cutoff. Market conditions change. The statistics Claude cites may be from three years ago, from a source that no longer publishes them, or from a source Claude has partially hallucinated.

This workflow will address:

- How to use Claude for market research in a way that distinguishes "this is a fact I sourced" from "this is a plausible extrapolation from my training data"
- Verification practices: how to check the provenance of a statistic before putting it in a memo
- How to use Claude to structure research questions and frameworks, even when you don't trust it for the data itself
- How to produce market research that a colleague or client could replicate in six months — meaning the sources are cited, the methodology is explicit, and the conclusions are appropriately hedged

## Target audience

Mid-career operators and analysts who need to produce market research quickly and need it to be defensible. Also: anyone who's been burned by a Claude-generated stat that turned out to be wrong or outdated, and wants a workflow that prevents this.

## The core discipline

The most reliable use of Claude for market research is as a **framework generator and synthesis engine**, not as a data source. Claude is excellent at: identifying what questions to ask, structuring a competitive landscape, synthesizing multiple sources you've gathered yourself, and stress-testing your conclusions. It is unreliable at: specific recent statistics, niche market data, and anything that has changed since its training cutoff.

This workflow will build on that distinction.
